#fix "import bluetooth" for virtual environment on raspberry pi:

# 0. get into virtual environment:
python3 -m venv ime
source ime/bin/activate

#1. rebuild pybluez:
git clone https://github.com/pybluez/pybluez.git
cd pybluez
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
# you can check modules with "pip list"

#2. if running 64-bit OS force 32-bit (worked for me):
sudo dpkg --add-architecture armhf
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev:armhf

#3. try importing bluetooth by typing "python" and in console "import bluetooth"

#4. debug:
#if you get error "can't import bluetooth._bluetooth"
#  -> pybluez wasn't installed correctly
